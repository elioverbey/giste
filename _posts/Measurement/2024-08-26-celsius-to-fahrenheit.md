The Celsius scale, also known as the centigrade scale, is a temperature scale that is widely used around the world for most temperature measurements, especially in science and most countries. It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, who first proposed a similar scale in 1742.

### Key Features of the Celsius Scale:

1. **Zero Point (0°C)**: 
   - **Freezing Point of Water**: The Celsius scale is based on the freezing point of water at standard atmospheric pressure, which is set at 0°C. This makes it intuitive for everyday use, especially in weather reporting.

2. **100 Degrees Point (100°C)**:
   - **Boiling Point of Water**: The boiling point of water, under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere), is set at 100°C. This was one of the original definitions used by Celsius.

3. **Intervals**:
   - The scale is divided into 100 equal intervals between the freezing point and the boiling point of water, hence the term "centigrade" (which means 100 degrees).

4. **Relationship to Kelvin**:
   - The Celsius scale is directly related to the Kelvin scale, which is used in scientific contexts. The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale, with 0 Kelvin (0 K) representing absolute zero, the point at which molecular motion ceases. The relationship between the two is simple:
     \[
     \text{Temperature in Kelvin (K)} = \text{Temperature in Celsius (°C)} + 273.15
     \]
   - For example, 0°C is equal to 273.15 K, and 100°C is equal to 373.15 K.

5. **Comparison to Fahrenheit**:
   - The Celsius scale is widely used in most parts of the world, while the Fahrenheit scale is still commonly used in the United States. The relationship between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Temperature in Celsius (°C)} = \frac{5}{9} \times (\text{Temperature in Fahrenheit (°F)} - 32)
     \]
   - Conversely:
     \[
     \text{Temperature in Fahrenheit (°F)} = \frac{9}{5} \times \text{Temperature in Celsius (°C)} + 32
     \]

### Practical Usage:
- **Everyday Use**: Celsius is commonly used in weather forecasts, cooking, and most general temperature measurements.
- **Scientific Use**: Because it is part of the metric system and directly related to Kelvin, Celsius is also standard in scientific contexts.

### History:
- Originally, Anders Celsius defined his scale with 0° as the boiling point of water and 100° as the freezing point, the reverse of today's system. After his death, the scale was reversed to the current form by Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, and others.

The Celsius scale is favored for its simplicity and logical alignment with the metric system, making it an essential tool for both everyday use and scientific measurement.
