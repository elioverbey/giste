### Overview of "Jeopardy!" Categories
"Jeopardy!" is a popular American television game show where contestants answer questions across various categories. Each episode typically features six categories per round, with each category containing five clues of increasing difficulty. The categories are essential to the game's structure, providing the thematic content that contestants must respond to.

### Common Types of Categories
1. **Traditional Knowledge Categories**: These include topics such as **History**, **Geography**, **Science**, **Literature**, and **Pop Culture**. They test contestants' general knowledge in these fields.

2. **Wordplay Categories**: Categories like **Rhyme Time**, **Before & After**, or **Anagrams** challenge contestants to play with language, often requiring them to think creatively or linguistically.

3. **Pop Culture & Entertainment**: Categories such as **Movies**, **Television**, **Music**, and **Famous People** tap into contestants' awareness of contemporary and historical pop culture.

4. **Potpourri or Grab Bag**: These are mixed categories, where the clues don't follow a specific theme, offering a surprise mix of topics.

5. **Puns & Wordplay Themes**: Some categories involve puns or wordplay based on the category title itself, which gives a hint about the nature of the clues (e.g., **"Fruitful Thoughts"** might involve clues about fruits or phrases related to fruit).

6. **Potent Potables**: A fan-favorite category that usually deals with alcoholic beverages and related trivia.

7. **Themed Categories**: These are based on specific themes, such as **"Shakespeare Quotes"**, **"U.S. Presidents"**, or **"World Capitals"**, often requiring deeper knowledge within that particular subject area.

8. **Visual & Audio Clues**: Occasionally, "Jeopardy!" includes categories where contestants must identify images, audio clips, or video clues.

9. **Historical Events & Figures**: Categories like **"World War II"** or **"Famous Scientists"** often require knowledge of specific events or individuals.

### Strategy for Categories
Contestants often develop strategies based on their strengths and weaknesses. Some may choose to tackle categories they are confident in first, while others might go for higher-value clues in categories they perceive as weaker to maximize their score early.

### Final Jeopardy!
The final round has one category where contestants wager their earnings on a single question. The category is revealed before the question, allowing contestants to gauge their confidence and adjust their wager accordingly.

The diversity and unpredictability of categories in "Jeopardy!" make it a challenging and engaging game, requiring contestants to have both broad and deep knowledge across a wide range of topics.
